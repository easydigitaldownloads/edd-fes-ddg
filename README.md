# Frontend Submissions Dummy Data Generator
With the increasing complexity of Frontend Submissions, the ability to quickly generate a ton of dummy data would really be useful. We'll work on this more post-2.3

Data Generated:
- Vendor accounts in various states
- Vendor products in various states
- Sales in various states with commission payments in various states
- more to come

A WordPress plugin with a CLI command ( fes-ddg generate )

Note: right now takes about 10-15 minutes to run on admin UI and about 8 minutes via CLI. Generates 60 vendor accounts with 300 downloads, a standard author with 1 download and 100 random orders.
