# Frontend Submissions Dummy Data Generator
With the increasing complexity of Frontend Submissions, the ability to quickly generate a ton of dummy data would really be useful. We'll work on this post-2.3

Data Generated:
- Vendor accounts in various states
- Vendor products in various states
- Sales with commission payments
- more to come

Will come as a WordPress plugin with a CLI component (that way we can use it on sites where CLI isn't possible or easy to do)
